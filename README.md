## Hello everyone, Iâ€™m Laurens!

Full-stack developer with a love of solving user problems through code; always open to new experiences, challenges, and seeing things trough different perspectives, product matters more than the individual.

I am a Dutch person that lived in Vancouver, Canada for 13 years, and returned back to call Amsterdam my home. (Helaas, mijn Nederlands is meer basis ðŸ˜…).

Recently, Iâ€™ve completed the intensive Full-Stack Development Bootcamp at [Codaisseur](https://codaisseur.com/) where I learned modern web development centered around React and Node.js.

Iâ€™ve also self-taught myself UI design and completed a bachelor degree in Communication Design (Graphic Design) from [Emily Carr University of Art + Design](https://www.ecuad.ca/). I have experience with startups work doing Branding and UI: [Design Portfolio](https://laurensdesign.design) (This I also coded from scratch)

## Projects

### Linktomyself
Linktomyself is a public homepage in a world where our digital life is spread across multiple platforms. Instead of replicating features of other services, it focuses solely on the most essential: name, bio, a list of links, and a gallery of favourite things such as Movies or Books with an optional link to a dedicated social platform (e.g IMDB, GoodReads). It has a clean and fully responsive design with a selection of color schemes for personalization

### Freezerdoor
Freezerdoor is a digital clone of the defunct [Top Gearâ„¢ Cool Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niCQ8pf1W4M) where they ranked cars based on coolness and placed them in one of four categories: Seriously Uncool, Uncool, Cool, or Subzero. Freezerdoor supports ~~bickering with your mates~~ bidirectional control trough Socket.io. Combined with a voice chat, it can be used for remote cool wall sessions. There is no authentication, so anyone with the server url(s) can create chaos. Images are stored as URLs to save on server costs.

### What if We Designed Novels?
An project about experimental e-books built and designed using web technologies as opposed to being merely formatted. Three samples were designed and developed, which integrated advanced typography, animation, and seamless illustrations.
