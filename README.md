## Hello everyone, I’m Amalie!

## (Some old) Projects

### Linktomyself
Linktomyself was a public homepage in a world where our digital life is spread across multiple platforms. Instead of replicating features of other services, it focuses solely on the most essential: name, bio, a list of links, and a gallery of favourite things such as Movies or Books with an optional link to a dedicated social platform (e.g IMDB, GoodReads). It has a clean and fully responsive design with a selection of color schemes for personalization

### Freezerdoor
Freezerdoor is a digital clone of the defunct [Top Gear™ Cool Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niCQ8pf1W4M) where they ranked cars based on coolness and placed them in one of four categories: Seriously Uncool, Uncool, Cool, or Subzero. Freezerdoor supports ~~bickering with your mates~~ bidirectional control trough Socket.io. Combined with a voice chat, it can be used for remote cool wall sessions. There is no authentication, so anyone with the server url(s) can create chaos. Images are stored as URLs to save on server costs.

### What if We Designed Novels?
An project about experimental e-books built and designed using web technologies as opposed to being merely formatted. Three samples were designed and developed, which integrated advanced typography, animation, and seamless illustrations.
