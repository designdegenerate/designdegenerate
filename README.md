## Hallo, I am Laurens

### About
Full-stack developer with a love of solving user problems trough code; always open to new experiences, challenges, and seeing things trough different perspectives, product matters more than the individual.

I am Dutch person that lived in Vancouver, Canada for 13 years, and returned back to call Amsterdam my home. Iâ€™m a fluent English speaker. Helaas, mijn Nederlands is meer basis ðŸ˜….

Recently, Iâ€™ve completed the intensive Full-Stack Development Bootcamp at [Codaisseur](https://codaisseur.com/) where I learned modern web development centered around React and Node.js.

Iâ€™ve also self-taught myself UI design and completed a bachelor degree in Communication Design (Graphic Design) from [Emily Carr University of Art + Design](https://ecuad.ca/). I have experience with startups work doing some UI and Branding. [Design Portfolio](https://laurensdesign.design).

#### Linktomyself
(add image here)

Linktomyself is a public homepage in a world where our digital life is spread across multiple platforms. Instead of replicating features of other services, it focuses solely on the most essential: name, bio, a list of links, and a gallery of favourite things such as Movies or Books with an optional link to a dedicated social platform (e.g IMDB, GoodReads). It has a clean and fully responsive design with dark mode support with a selection of color schemes for personalization.
